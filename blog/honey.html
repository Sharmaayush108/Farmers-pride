      <h1 >Honey</h1>
        <p>
            Honey is much more than just a simple sugar. For thousands of years, honey has been used by us in many capacities to help give the desired level of energy and health.  It is produced by honeybees from the nectar of flowers and used by humans as a sweetener and a spread. 
It helps in weight loss, improving metabolism, skin glow, reducing cholesterol and brain development as well. Heoney also has anti-septic and anti-bacterial properties. 
Honey is comprised of 17-20% water, 76-80% glucose, and fructose, pollen, wax, and mineral salts. Its composition and colour is dependent upon the type of flower that supplies the nectar. For example, mustard flower produces a yellow- orange kind of honey, neem flowers-brown colour etc. Each variety of honey has different set of characteristics that makes it unique. Some of the main characteristics are colour, granulation, moisture content, Levlose (fructose sugars) levels and Dextrose (glucose sugars) levels.
Over its history as a food, the main uses of honey are in cooking, baking, desserts, such as a spread on bread, as an addition to various beverages, such as tea, and as a sweetener in some commercial beverages. 
SUBSTITUTING HONEY FOR SUGAR
Replace 1 cup of sugar with 3/4 cup of honey and reduce the liquid in the recipe by ¼ cup. Add a pinch of baking soda to recipes that do not call for sour cream or sour milk, so as to reduce the acidity of the honey. Cook jellies and jams at higher temperatures when you replace sugar with honey. Beat honey candies longer, and seal them more tightly when storing them to keep the honey from absorbing atmospheric moisture.
TIPS 
When baking with honey, lower the oven temperature by 25° to 30° F to prevent over-browning. 
When measuring honey, first coat the measuring utensil with a small amount of oil so the honey will not stick.
Store honey at room temperature rather than in a refrigerator. Keep it tightly covered and in a dry place.
If honey granulates, place its container in hot water until the honey re-liquefies. Honey, because it is hydroscopic, tends to keep foods moist and tender. Therefore, if you are baking goodies for kids away at school, service members overseas, or friends out of town, always bake with honey to ensure freshness.
<br><b>Caution – We should not boil or heat honey directly.</b>
