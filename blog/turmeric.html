      <h1 >Turmeric (Haldi)</h1>
        <p>

        The Asian root spice of turmeric or haldi hardly needs any introduction. The spice is made from the root of a flowering plant that belongs to the ginger family and is native to the Indian subcontinent, as well as some parts of Southeast Asia. The rhizomes of the plant are gathered and then dried in direct sunlight, before they are ground to make the powder that we all know so well. We probably know turmeric as the main spice in curry. It has a warm, bitter taste and is frequently used to flavour or colour curry powders, mustards, butters, and cheeses. A number of home remedies for a wide variety of small and big ailments include turmeric powder as one of the ingredients and it is also used to enhance beauty and heal wounds.
        
        Turmeric Health Benefits
        Turmeric has a number of health benefits including naturally cooling the body and also improving immunity. A number of studies have proven the antioxidant properties of the spice as well. This is why golden milk and golden lattes with turmeric powder in them have started making appearances in cafes around the world. Most of the benefits of turmeric have been credited to the presence of certain compounds called curcuminhoids. In turmeric powder, about 1 to 6 per cent curcuminhoids are present, which lend the spice its antioxidant properties. Along with curcumihoids, turmeric also has some 34 essential oils. These compounds lend turmeric its health benefits which include protecting the brain, boosting digestion and immunity, providing relief from arthritic pain and even prevention of cancer!
