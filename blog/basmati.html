      <h1 >Traditional Dehraduni Basmati Rice</h1>
        <p>
            Dehraduni basmati gets its name from the city of Dehradun, capital of the northern Indian state of Uttarakhand, in the foothills of the Himalayas, where it has been grown for centuries on small family farms. Dehraduni basmati is the authentic Indian basmati . Dehraduni's famed flavour, fragrance and elongation are what elevated basmati rice to one of the world's most recognized and best-loved rice’s. Dehraduni basmati is a long slender, aromatic grain that almost doubles in length when cooked. The word 'basmati' comes from the Sanskrit word for 'fragrant.' 
            Dehraduni basmati is recognized as the 'mother of all basmati.' It is a landrace, which means it is a locally adapted variety with a distinct identity of historical origin and lacks any formal crop improvement.
